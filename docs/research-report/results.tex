\subsection{Quality evaluation}

The RNA-seq data was initially assessed with FastQC\index{FastQC}, and according to this assessment the data was preprocessed/trimmed with Trimmomatic\index{Trimmomatic} and afterwards assessed again with FastQC (see section \ref{RNA-seq-preprocessing}). Finally, an overall report on the data preprocessing, the quality assessments and the kallisto\index{kallisto} pseudoalignments was created with MultiQC\index{MultiQC}.

Figure \ref{fig:0.1-MultiQC_FastQC_status_checks} shows the MultiQC report on the Trimmomatic\index{Trimmomatic} preprocessing (the surviving reads).

Figure \ref{fig:0.2-MultiQC_FastQC_status_checks} shows the MultiQC overview of the FastQC\index{FastQC} quality assessments of the trimmed FASTQ files.

According to these quality assessments, the (trimmed) RNA-seq data may be regarded as good quality for the purpose of this research.


\subsection{Reads mapped to the reference transcriptome}

For most of the FASTQ files, kallisto pseudoaligned well above 80 \% of the (preprocessed) RNA-seq reads. Figure \ref{fig:0.3-MultiQC_kallisto_alignment} shows a MultiQC overview of the kallisto\index{kallisto} pseudoalignments.
