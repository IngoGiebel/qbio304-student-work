\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}
Introduce and explain the study and give a rationale for the RNA-seq analysis. Discuss why of RNA sequencing in understanding gene expression and regulation in plants and why it is used in this study.

\subsection{Objectives}
State the specific aims of the assignment, which include obtaining plant RNA-seq data, evaluating its quality, mapping to a respective genome, performing statistical evaluation, differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and critically evaluating and discussing the results.
